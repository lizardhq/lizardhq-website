title: "Security Advisory: File Read/Write as SYSTEM Vulnerability in MacPaw CleanMyPC"

# Overview

CleanMyPC "is more than a PC cleaner — it’s an essential tool that cares for your computer".

An issue in CleanMyPC, versions 1.8.1.570 and below, can be exploited by a local attacker to read from and write to any file on the system with SYSTEM privileges. This can lead to local privilege escalation.

# Issues

CleanMyPC bundles a service, named `CleanMyPCService` which exposes various WCF services as named pipes.

One of the services exposed is `CmpDataFilesService` which exposes two methods: `byte[] GetCleanMyPCDataFileContent(string fileName)` which returns the content of `fileName`, read as SYSTEM, and `void SaveCleanMyPCDataFileContent(string fileName, byte[] content)` which writes `content` to `fileName`, again as SYSTEM.

Both methods try to work with a specific relative path; `GetCleanMyPCDataFileContent` if the file exists in that relative path (but this is always false if you pass an absolute path); and `SaveCleanMyPCDataFileContent` if the write failed with the path that was passed to it.

A PoC is [available](https://lizardhq.org/files/climbmypc.zip): `climbmypc.cs` attempts to use this issue to copy between two passed file locations as SYSTEM.

# Affected Versions

Version 1.8.1.570 and below.

# Solution

Uninstallation of this software will prevent exploitation of the issue. The researchers cannot sanction any mitigations except to remove this software definitively from any affected devices.

Thanks to Techdirt for [their accidental promotion of CleanMyPC](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161118/09225436083/daily-deal-cleanmypc-single-license-sorry-about-that.shtml). Without it, I probably wouldn't have found the software to audit it.
